## Project title
Bayesian Model for Gastrointestinal nematodes
# Project description
This hierarchical Bayesian model analyzes parasitological data by examining infection dynamics, fecal egg counts, and serum IgA levels in livestock, incorporating biological and management factors to assess treatment effectiveness and the influence of host traits and environmental conditions on parasite burden and immune response, ultimately supporting evidence-based livestock management and breeding strategies.
## Features
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling with JAGS.
- Analysis of treatment effects on parasite burden.
- Exploration of host traits like sex, age, and breed.
- Support for overdispersed fecal egg count data.
## Requirements
- R
- Packages: `runjags`, `rjags`, `ggplot2`
